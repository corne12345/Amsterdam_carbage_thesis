_By Corn√© Heijnen 12230170_

This repository is the code for the master thesis research project for the master Data Science in the year 2019-2020. The goal of this thesis is to optimize the configuration of the different fraction of underground garbage containers in the city of Amsterdam.

### Structure
All coding has been initially done in Jupyter Notebooks. All succesfull and reusable parts of these notebooks are encapsulated into codes and eventually added as Python-files (.py). These Python files in turn contain functions that can be loaded in into other Notebooks.
