This folder contains all iPython Jupyter Notebooks that are used for testing and exploration of data and files. These notebooks themselves will not be used in the final product, but help in the process of coming up with results. All notebooks start with the date (YYYYMMDD) they were created, to ensure a chronological order in them and to see the buildup. The filenames are descriptions of the research questions or goals these notebooks try to solve
