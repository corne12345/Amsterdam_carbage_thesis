The Code folder contains all encapsulated code in the form of functions. The files are .py files and these files or parts thereof can be imported for implementation in other notebooks or Python files. These functions all have descriptons of what they do, what input and output is associated with them and when to use them.

helper_functions.py contains most of the functions needed.
loading_data.py contains all functions that actively load data from external services.
algorithms.py is a summary of all algorithms used.
